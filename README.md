## Hi there, I&lsquo;m Arsam! 👋

🧑🏻‍💻 I am a software engineer, product maker and a lifelong learner. I build new products from scratch and make ideas happen!

- 🔭 I’m currently rebuilding [my personal website][arsam] using NextJs and Tailwind CSS
- 🌱 I’m currently brushing up on my VueJs and learning to code in Rust
- 👯 My goal for 2021 is to contribute to more Open Source projects, and starting writting a technical blog
